Development Enviroment Bootstrap Automation with Vagrant and Puppet

1/ What is Vagrant?
	-> Automates the roll out of virtual machines
	-> You'll need: Ruby and Virtual Box installed

2/ What is puppet?
	-> Automates set up of a system
	-> You could also use chef

3/ What is RVM?
	-> Controls multiple versions of ruby on a system
	-> Good example as it doesn't use packaged files

4/ Why?
	-> Everyone works from identical, not nearly identical setups.
		* Be certain that everything you need is installed
		* Be certain that nothing unexpected is installed that could introduce unexpected side effects
	-> Keep multiple projects in clean enviroments

5/ My RVM Problem
	* RVM installs ruby successfully even if some optional requirements aren't on your system, but some gems might not install correctly.


// Example

a/ select a base
b/ vagrant up (Go make get some coffee)
c/ set up puppet manifest
d/ vagrant reload
e/ work!
	-> vagrant ssh
	or ssh to localhost:8080
	or work locally
f/ destory
g/ do it again!

// Vagrant Can:
	-> Setup IP Addresses
	-> Port forward from host to virtual machine
	-> Control multiple systems in one go - eg, a web server and database server


// Puppet Can:
	-> Install system packages (eg, apt-get ) - Or make sure they aren't installed
	-> Execute commands (eg, "apt-get update") - Can be based on conditions
	-> Create files and directories - and set their permissions
	-> create users and groups - and modify them
	-> ensure services are running - or stopped
	-> Create reusable modules and classes to bundle instructions and templates
	-> Sync to a "puppet master" server ! Not Covered - Adds a layer of complixity I don't want 

g (Or else!)
